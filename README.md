This is the Laravel package called "input" and serves as an extract-map-load configuration (EML) as part of the datatank core application (tdt/core). The current instances of the eml stack are focussed on semantifying data. This means that raw data can be transformed into semantic data by providing a mapping file.

Future work exists in extracting data from large files and loading them into a NoSQL store. This endpoint can then be exploited freely, or proxied by the datatank core.
